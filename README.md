# GPTBridgeBook

Another one of my pet projects - this time, my interest in applying prompt engineering to a game I really love, the card game bridge. I'll be uploading some of the LLM's responses/thinking (if I'm using DeepSeek) here. Mainly it'll be like an expanded appendix for the book (link will be given once I finish writing & publish the book)
